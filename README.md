# Lap Timer Companion

This is the companion app for my [lap-timer](https://github.com/jai-sinha/lap-timer) Garmin app. It is written in Swift and uses the Connect IQ iOS SDK to communicate with the lap-timer app over Bluetooth.

## Goals

- Save and display sessions recorded by the watch app
- Send track coordinates to the watch app

## Notes

- This project heavily borrows from this example's Swift implementation of the Connect IQ iOS SDK (as opposed to the Objective-C example provided by Garmin). (Thanks, Doug!)
